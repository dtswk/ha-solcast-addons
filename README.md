Based on the amazing work for BJReplay, daringer and RomRider.

We are totally off grid and have been using Node-Red previosly and made the leap to Home Assistant.

I spent a few hours starting with the UI and thought I would share back what I made.  I'm still deciding if I move all the logic from node-red or leave it there.....

Most of our automations are very conservative and are based on the worst case.

The files I have shared create some additional senors to a the sum of the P10 forecasts so they are more easily accessible.

I also hacked together a sensor with attributes so i could more easily create a table using flex-cards.

Hopefully this helps someone else and if you have improvements please share.  :-)
